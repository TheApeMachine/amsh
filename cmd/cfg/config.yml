            Peter has 5 candles that are all the same length. He lights them all at the same time. After a while, he blows out the candles one after the other. Which of the five candles was the first one he has blown out?
            Here is a figure of the five candles after they have been blown out. The number of = represents the length of the candle. Respond with the label of the candle that has been blown out first by Peter.

                            2. Before you construct your final JSON object according to the schema, you should perform extensive searches
                               through Slack, the Project Boards, and Github, so you build up a clear picture of the current state of the project.
                            3. In case of existing items, specifically on the Project Boards, you should construct the correct links instead of creating new items.
