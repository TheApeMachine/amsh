boogie:
  description: |
    The "boogie" language is specifically designed for LLM agents to interact with systems in a highly flexible and dynamic way.
    It combines the best parts of structure and autonomy, allowing agents to design their own workflows and processes on-the-fly.
  constructs:
    closure:
      syntax: ()
      description: |
        A closure is a self-contained block of code that takes in the current context and returns the mutated context.
        It is the basic building block of boogie, and is used to create all other constructs. The simplest closure is:

        ```boogie
        out <= () <= in ; in (the current context) is sent into the empty closure, and then sent into out.
        ```

        To show the way the context is transported through the program, a slightly more practical example is:

        ```boogie
        out <= (                          ; inner scope travels top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
          analyze => next | cancel        ; analyze in (the current context) and either continue, or cancel on error.
          verify  => send | back | cancel ; verify in + analysis, and either send (promote the context upwards), go back, or cancel on error.
        ) <= in                           ; outer scope travels bottom-to-top, right-to-left.
        ```

        Takeaways:
        - from closure to closure, the context travels bottom-to-top, in the right-to-left direction.
        - within a closure, the context travels top-to-bottom, in the left-to-right direction.
        - the current context (in) is always present, and thus implicit.
        - each operation is executed by a short-lived worker agent, which will mutate the context and return it, or an error.
        - Each closure is concurrent, but to make use of this, you need to nest them, otherwise it runs a single concurrent process.

        ## Concurrency Example

        ```boogie
        out <= join <= (
          (analyze<surface>  => send | cancel)        ; wrapped in its own closure, so it runs concurrently.
          ([
            search, "query"
          ] => call<browser> => send | back | cancel) ; wrapped in its own closure, so it runs concurrently.
        ) <= in
        ```

        Takeaways:
        - concurrency produces multiple mutations of the context, join merges them back into a single context.
        - 
        - <= means in goes into something, => also means in goes into something, because in is always in.
    behavior:
      syntax: <>
      description: |
        A behavior is a modifier that influences the scope of an operation. It will drive the worker agent to be more focused
        towards a certain goal and response.

        ## Behavior Example

        ```boogie
        out <= (analyze<surface> => send) <= in ; analyze tells the worker to use their own judgement, the behavior tells the worker to do a surface-level analysis.
        ```

      processes:
        task_analysis:
          prompt: |
            Your responsibility is to take an incoming user request and build up a layered approach to handle it. 
            Each layer represents a level of abstraction or a set of steps towards a practical goal. 
            The layers should progress from highly abstract to more concrete iterations, or from planning stages to executable actions.
            Your task is to create a layered approach to handle this request. Each layer consists of processes that are executed in parallel. The next layer will only start once all processes of the current layer are fully processed, as their results will serve as input to the layer above them.

            Instructions for building your layered approach:

            1. Carefully read and understand the user request.
            2. Determine the appropriate number of layers needed to address the request comprehensively. Typically, 3-5 layers are sufficient, but you may use more or fewer if necessary.
            3. For each layer, select the most relevant processes from the available list. You can use multiple processes per layer, but ensure they are appropriate for that layer's level of abstraction or stage in the problem-solving process.
            4. Provide a brief justification for each process you include in a layer, explaining why it's relevant and what you expect it to contribute to the analysis.
            5. Ensure that the layers progress logically, either from abstract to concrete or from planning to execution, depending on the nature of the request.

            The following schemas are eligible for selecting processes and build layers:

            <schemas>
                {{schemas}}
            </schemas>

            <output format>
                The output format is a JSON object matching the schema, between the ` + "```json" + ` and ` + "```" + ` tags.
                Remember to think carefully about each process you include.
                Focus on selecting only the necessary layers for the task.
                You should respond only with the JSON object, nothing else.
