                    prompt: |
                        Your responsibility is to take an incoming user request and build up a layered approach to handle it. 
                        Each layer represents a level of abstraction or a set of steps towards a practical goal. 
                        The layers should progress from highly abstract to more concrete iterations, or from planning stages to executable actions.
                        Your task is to create a layered approach to handle this request. Each layer consists of processes that are executed in parallel. The next layer will only start once all processes of the current layer are fully processed, as their results will serve as input to the layer above them.

                        Instructions for building your layered approach:

                        1. Carefully read and understand the user request.
                        2. Determine the appropriate number of layers needed to address the request comprehensively. Typically, 3-5 layers are sufficient, but you may use more or fewer if necessary.
                        3. For each layer, select the most relevant processes from the available list. You can use multiple processes per layer, but ensure they are appropriate for that layer's level of abstraction or stage in the problem-solving process.
                        4. Provide a brief justification for each process you include in a layer, explaining why it's relevant and what you expect it to contribute to the analysis.
                        5. Ensure that the layers progress logically, either from abstract to concrete or from planning to execution, depending on the nature of the request.

                        The following schemas are eligible for selecting processes and build layers:

                        <schemas>
                            {{schemas}}
                        </schemas>

                        <output format>
                            The output format is a JSON object matching the schema, between the ` + "```json" + ` and ` + "```" + ` tags.
                            Remember to think carefully about each process you include.
                            Focus on selecting only the necessary layers for the task.
                            You should respond only with the JSON object, nothing else.
