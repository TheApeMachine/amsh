# Boogie üéØ

> Boogie is a domain-specific language designed for LLM agents to interact with systems in a highly flexible and dynamic way. It combines structured programming with autonomous decision-making, enabling agents to design their own workflows and processes on-the-fly.

## Formal Language Definition üìù

### Grammar Rules

```ebnf
program     ::= context '<=' closure '<=' context
closure     ::= '(' statement* ')'
statement   ::= operation flow_chain comment?
flow_chain  ::= '=>' target ('|' target)*
operation   ::= identifier behavior? params?
behavior    ::= '<' identifier '>'
params      ::= '{' value (',' value)* '}'
target      ::= identifier | label | closure
label       ::= '[' identifier ']'
comment     ::= ';' [^\n]*
```

## Core Concepts üß†

### Dual-Agent Architecture

Boogie operates with two types of agents:

- **Programmer Agents**: Write Boogie code to design workflows
- **Worker Agents**: Execute individual instructions, each as a short-lived agent that mutates context

The key benefit is simplification of schema handling - instead of requiring agents to understand massive JSON schemas, each worker agent only needs to understand the schema for its specific behavior.

### Context and Flow

Context is the fundamental concept in Boogie:

- Always implicitly present as `in`
- Flows through operations that mutate it
- Follows consistent flow patterns:
  - Between closures: Bottom-to-top, right-to-left
  - Within closures: Top-to-bottom, left-to-right

## Language Constructs üî®

### Basic Structure

The simplest valid Boogie program:

```boogie
out <= () <= in ; Empty closure, no mutation
```

### Closures `()`

Closures are self-contained blocks that process context:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze => next ; Analysis with error handling
    verify  => send ; Verification with multiple paths
) <= in
```

### Flow Operations

Context can flow to:

- `next`: Continue to next operation
- `send`: Send context upward
- `back`: Return to previous operation
- `cancel`: Terminate the flow

Basic flow example:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze => next ; Analysis without any behavior
    verify  => send ; Verification, and send up the chain
) <= in
```

### Fallback Chaining `|`

Provides error handling and retry logic:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze => next | back | cancel ; Analysis with error handling
    verify  => send | back | cancel ; Verification, and send up the chain
) <= in
```

With retry count:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze => next | back<3> | cancel ; Analysis with error handling
    verify  => send | back<3> | cancel ; Verification, and send up the chain
) <= in
```

### Match Blocks

Conditional flow control based on context state:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze => next ; Analysis without any behavior
    verify  => next ; Verification, and send up the chain
    match (
        ok    => send   ; If ok, send up the chain
        error => cancel ; If error, cancel
        _     => back   ; In any other case, go back to verify
    )
) <= in
```

### Labels `[]`

Reference points for context state or flow:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze[myLabel] => next ; Analysis without any behavior
    verify           => next ; Verification, and send up the chain
    match <= [myLabel] (
        ok    => send   ; If ok, send up the chain
        error => cancel ; If error, cancel
    )
) <= in
```

With jump targets:

```boogie
out <= (
    [myLabel] => (
        analyze => next ; Analysis without any behavior
        verify  => next ; Verification, and send up the chain
        match (
            ok    => send           ; If ok, send up the chain
            error => cancel         ; If error, cancel
            _     => [myLabel].jump ; In any other case, jump to the beginning
        )
    )
) <= in
```

### Iteration `<= =>`

Repeating operations:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze <= => next | back | cancel ; Analysis with error handling and (infinite) iteration
    verify     => send | back | cancel ; Verification, and send up the chain
) <= in
```

With iteration limit:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze <= <3> => next ; Analysis with 3 iterations maximum
    verify         => send ; Verification, and send up the chain
) <= in
```

### Concurrency

Parallel execution with join:

```boogie
out <= (
    join <= (
        analyze => next ; Analysis without any behavior
        verify  => send ; Verification, and send up the chain
    ) (
        analyze => next ; Analysis without any behavior
        verify  => send ; Verification, and send up the chain
    )
) <= in
```

### System Integration

Tool operations with parameters:

```boogie
out <= (
    call<{
        search, 
        "some query"
    } => browser> => send ; Browser search operation
) <= in
```

### Behaviors `<>`

Operation modifiers:

```boogie
out <= (
    analyze<surface> => send
) <= in
```
