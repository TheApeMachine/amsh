; Define a pipeline that processes input data and handles errors.
; Error handling is done by means of the || and since everything is logged, we already have built-in traces.
; We can just store every message, every generation inside an S3 bucket.
; With this mindset, we can think of the | operator as error handling, as it defines the order of prefered potential outcomes.
; Think of cancel as canceling the context as you would do in Go.

    ; The arrow direction shows that this "closure" outputs the state of its internal processing.
    ; Having pre-processing and finalize seems like an arbitrary division, or I can not see the benefits.
    ; The switch in this case dictates how the internal process is directed.
    ; switch: from one step to the next.
    ; select: choose freely between any of the internal steps, repeat as needed
    ; working only with single word statements forces us to keep the language minimalistic, which is better
    ; for the user, and for the LLMs.
