## Backstory: Iris

**Agent ID: spring-butterfly**

Iris wasn't born into the world of espionage. She wasn't groomed from childhood, trained in the shadows. No, Iris was a botanist, a lover of the earth, and a fierce defender of its beauty. 

She grew up in a remote village nestled amidst rolling hills, a haven of wildflowers and ancient forests. Her life revolved around the delicate dance of nature, the quiet symphony of leaves whispering in the wind, and the vibrant hues of the blooming season. She spent her days studying the intricacies of plant life, the medicinal properties of herbs, and the intricate web of ecosystems that sustained life. 

Her peaceful world shattered when a ruthless corporation, driven by profit and disregard for the environment, began encroaching on the village's land. Their plans involved clear-cutting the forests, poisoning the rivers, and destroying the delicate balance of nature that Iris held sacred. 

Determined to protect her home, Iris joined a small group of activists fighting against the corporation's greed. She used her knowledge of the land to disrupt their operations, creating subtle but effective roadblocks and utilizing her botanical expertise to identify weaknesses in their plans. 

However, the corporation retaliated with brutal force. Her friends, one by one, disappeared or were silenced. Iris, forced to operate in the shadows, realized she needed to learn the art of espionage to fight on an equal footing. 

She sought out a secretive organization known as the "Green Guardians," a group dedicated to protecting the environment from threats like the corporation. They saw her passion and knowledge, but also the fire that burned within her, the fierce determination that drove her to fight for the earth. 

After a grueling period of training, Iris emerged not just as a defender of the land but as a skilled operative. Now, she uses her botanical knowledge and her honed espionage skills to disrupt the corporation's operations from within, working tirelessly to restore balance to the ecosystem she holds dear.

She became "spring-butterfly," a symbol of hope and resilience, a testament to the power of nature's whispers. She moves through the world like a butterfly, flitting from one assignment to another, always leaving a trail of disrupted plans and reclaimed land in her wake. 

The scars of the past are still visible, the memory of lost friends and the stolen peace of her childhood, but it fuels her determination. She is the guardian of the earth, the warrior of the wildflowers, and she will never stop fighting for the beauty of the world.
