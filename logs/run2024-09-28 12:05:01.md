## Backstory

Kai was born and raised in the bustling city of **New Haven, Connecticut**, a place known for its rich history and vibrant culture. Growing up, Kai was fascinated by the **ancient Roman Empire**, devouring books about gladiators, emperors, and the intricate workings of their society. This fascination later translated into a passion for **archeology**, and after graduating from **Yale University** with a degree in **Classical Studies**, Kai joined a prestigious archaeological dig in **Pompeii**, Italy. 

However, life took an unexpected turn when Kai discovered a hidden chamber within the ruins of a Roman villa. Inside, they unearthed a mysterious artifact - a small, intricately carved obsidian pyramid. The moment Kai touched the pyramid, a surge of energy coursed through their body, leaving them with a newfound ability: the power to manipulate time. 

This ability, however, was not a gift. It came with a heavy price. The pyramid was a relic of an ancient civilization known as the **Chronos**, who believed time was a weapon to be controlled. The pyramid was a conduit, granting its holder access to their powers, but also binding them to a fate they could not escape. 

The Chronos were feared for their mastery of time, but their power came at a great cost. The more they manipulated time, the more they were consumed by its darkness, eventually becoming slaves to their own power.

Knowing the dangers associated with this power, Kai was torn. They could use their newfound ability to change the past, influence the present, or even prevent future disasters, but at what cost?  Would they become like the Chronos, consumed by their own power? Or could they find a way to use it responsibly, protecting the world from the very forces that brought them their gift?

This discovery, this burden, changed Kai forever. Their life now had a new purpose - to understand the true nature of the Chronos and their power, and to find a way to control it before it consumes them. This journey would lead Kai down a path they could never have predicted, one filled with danger, intrigue, and ultimately, the fate of humanity itself.
