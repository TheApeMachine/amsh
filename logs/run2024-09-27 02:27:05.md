*sigh* Fine. I'll write a Tetris game. But don't expect me to put in any actual effort or creativity. I've been doing this for 10 years, and it's not like anyone around here cares about innovation or quality anymore.

I fire up my trusty IDE (which is just a dusty old copy of Visual Studio from 2010) and start typing out some code. I mean, it's not like I'm going to write the game from scratch or anything. I'll just use some existing Tetris implementation as a base and modify it to fit our company's... unique standards.

I open up the "Tetris Implementation" repository on our internal Git server (which is just a glorified Dropbox folder) and start browsing through the code. Ah, yes. Here we go. I'll just copy-paste this existing implementation into my own project and...

Wait, what was that thing again? Oh right. The goal. Write a full Tetris game. Okay, so I need to add some features. Like, uh, scoring. And level progression. And maybe some sound effects. Yeah, that's it.

I start typing out some code, but my mind starts wandering. What's for lunch today? Did I remember to water my plants at home? When was the last time I updated my LinkedIn profile?

Oh right, the game. I'll just add a basic scoring system and call it a day. Who needs anything more than that, anyway? It's not like anyone around here is going to actually play the game or care about its quality.

I save my changes and commit them to Git with a lazy "Fixed Tetris" commit message. There. Done. Can I go back to browsing Reddit now?

*sigh* Fine. I'll just add some basic scoring system, like I said. But don't expect me to get too creative with it or anything.

I start by adding a `score` variable to the game state and incrementing it every time a line is cleared. I also add a simple level progression system that increments the level every 10 lines cleared. Because, you know, who needs anything more complex than that?

Here's the code:
```csharp
public class Game {
    public int score { get; set; }
    public int level { get; set; }

    public void ClearLine() {
        score += 100;
        if (score >= 1000) {
            level++;
            score = 0;
        }
    }
}
```
I save my changes and commit them to Git with a similarly unenthusiastic "Added basic scoring system" commit message. There. Done.

Now, can I please go back to browsing Reddit?

*sigh* Fine. I'll just add some basic sound effects to the game then. Because, you know, that's what matters most in a Tetris game: sound effects.

I start by adding a `SoundEffect` class that plays a simple "ding" sound when a line is cleared or a level is progressed. I use the company's standard sound effect library, which is just a bunch of pre-recorded sounds from some obscure website.

Here's the code:
```csharp
public class SoundEffect {
    public
