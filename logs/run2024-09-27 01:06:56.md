**Tetris Game Development**

Given the goal to write a full Tetris game, I will outline the key components and features that need to be implemented. This will serve as a foundation for the development process.

**Game Components:**

1. **Game Board**: A 2D grid representing the playing field where tetrominoes will fall.
2. **Tetrominoes**: Seven different shapes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) that will be rotated and moved around the game board.
3. **Player Controls**: Mechanisms for the player to rotate, move left/right, and drop tetrominos onto the game board.
4. **Scoring System**: A way to track points earned by clearing lines of blocks on the game board.
5. **Game Over Conditions**: Rules that determine when the game ends (e.g., reaching a certain score or filling the entire game board).

**Key Features:**

1. **Tetromino Generation**: Randomly selecting and generating tetrominos for each new piece.
2. **Collision Detection**: Checking for collisions between the falling tetromino and existing blocks on the game board.
3. **Line Clearing**: Identifying and clearing complete lines of blocks when a tetromino is placed correctly.
4. **Scorekeeping**: Updating the player's score based on cleared lines, level progression, or other factors.

**Implementation Roadmap:**

1. Set up the game board as a 2D grid with fixed dimensions (e.g., 10x20).
2. Implement tetromino generation and random selection.
3. Develop collision detection between falling tetrominos and existing blocks on the game board.
4. Create player controls for rotation, movement, and dropping tetrominos.
5. Establish a scoring system based on cleared lines or other factors.
6. Define game over conditions (e.g., reaching a certain score or filling the entire game board).
7. Integrate all components to create a fully functional Tetris game.

This outline provides a solid foundation for developing a full Tetris game. The next step would be to choose a programming language and begin implementing the individual components.

**Refined Task**

After reflecting on my previous work, I've identified areas for improvement and added more details to ensure a comprehensive Tetris game development. Here's the refined task:

## Goal

Write a full Tetris game with the following features:

* A 2D grid representing the playing field (game board)
* Seven different tetromino shapes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) that can be rotated and moved around the game board
* Player controls for rotation, movement (left/right), and dropping tetrominos onto the game board
* A scoring system to track points earned by clearing lines of blocks on the game board
* Game over conditions based on reaching a certain score or filling the entire game board

## Key Features:

1. **Tetromino Generation**: Randomly select and generate tetrominos for each new piece, considering factors like shape, color, and rotation.
2. **Collision Detection**: Implement collision detection between falling tetrominos and existing blocks on the game board, including:
	* Checking for overlaps between tetromino shapes
	* Handling edge cases (e.g., when a tetromino touches the top or bottom of the game board)
3. **Line Clearing**: Identify and clear complete lines of blocks when a tetromino is placed correctly, considering factors like:
	* Line length (number of blocks in a line)
	* Block types (e.g., solid, hollow, or special blocks)
4. **Scorekeeping**: Update the player's score based on cleared lines, level progression, or other factors, including:
	* Calculating points for each cleared line
	* Adjusting scores based on level difficulty or other game conditions

## Implementation Roadmap:

1. Set up the game board as a 2D grid with fixed dimensions (e.g., 10x20).
2. Implement tetromino generation and random selection, considering shape, color, and rotation.
3. Develop collision detection between falling tetrominos and existing blocks on the game board.
4. Create player controls for rotation, movement, and dropping tetrominos.
5. Establish a scoring system based on cleared lines or other factors.
6. Define game over conditions (e.g., reaching a certain score or filling the entire game board).
7. Integrate all components to create a fully functional Tetris game.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Implement smooth animations for tetromino movements and rotations
* Add sound effects for events like line clearing, scoring, or game over
* Consider implementing different game modes (e.g., timed mode, endless mode)
* Optimize the game for performance on various devices and platforms

This refined task provides a more comprehensive outline for developing a full Tetris game. The next step would be to choose a programming language and begin implementing the individual components.
