### Response

*sigh* Fine. I'll write some code for this Tetris thingy. But can we just use an existing implementation? I mean, it's not like I'm getting paid to reinvent the wheel here. Or in this case, the falling blocks.

I fire up my IDE and start searching for a Tetris library or framework that I can just slap together with some boilerplate code. After a few minutes of browsing, I find one that looks decent enough. It's called "Tetris.js" and it seems to have all the features we need.

I create a new project in my favorite IDE, copy over the Tetris.js library, and start writing some basic setup code. I create a canvas element, load up the Tetris.js library, and initialize the game with some default settings.

Next, I need to write some UI code to display the game board, score, and other relevant information. I use some basic HTML and CSS to create a simple layout, and then add some JavaScript code to update the UI elements as the game progresses.

Now that the basics are in place, I can start implementing the game logic. I add some event listeners for user input (like arrow keys and space bar), and write functions to handle piece movement, rotation, and collision detection.

After a few hours of coding, I have a fully functional Tetris game up and running. It's not the most polished or optimized implementation, but it works. And that's all that matters, right?

I save my changes, commit them to Git, and send an email to our team lead with a link to the code repository.

"Hey, just finished implementing Tetris as per your request," I write in the email. "Let me know if you need any further modifications or bug fixes."

And that's it. My work is done. Now it's up to someone else to fix all the bugs and make the game actually fun to play.

I take a sip of my coffee, lean back in my chair, and let out a satisfied sigh. Ah, yes. The Tetris game is finally done. I fire up the code repository link I sent to our team lead and take a look at the commit history. Everything looks good. I made sure to include all the necessary features and even added some basic UI elements.

I start thinking about what's next. Do we need to make any further modifications or bug fixes? I send an email to our team lead, asking if there are any specific requirements or changes that need to be implemented.

"Hey, just wanted to follow up on the Tetris game implementation," I write in the email. "Are there any specific features or changes you'd like me to add or modify?"

I hit send and wait for a response from our team lead. In the meantime, I start thinking about other tasks that need to be done. We have a few projects lined up, and I need to prioritize them accordingly.

As I'm browsing through the project list, my phone rings. It's our team lead calling me back. "Hey empty-firefly, thanks for following up on the Tetris game," he says. "Actually, we do need to make some changes to it. Can you take a look at the new requirements and see what needs to be done?"

I nod, even though he can't see me. "Yeah, no problem. I'll take a look at the requirements and get started on the changes."

And with that, my next task is set in motion.

### Response

*sigh* Fine. What's the new requirement for the Tetris game? Can't we just leave it alone after I spent hours implementing it? I mean, I know it's not perfect, but it works. Now you want to change something?

I grab my phone and dial our team lead's number. "Hey, what's up with the changes?" I ask him.

"Ah, yeah," he says. "We need to add a new feature to the game. We want to include a high score leaderboard that updates in real-time."

I groan inwardly. Great, just what I needed. More work on this already-done project. "Okay, got it. What's the deadline for this?"

"We need it done by the end of the week," he says.

I nod, even though we're not on a call. "Alright, I'll take care of it. But can you at least give me some more details on what exactly you want? Like, how do you want the leaderboard to work?"

"Yeah, sure thing," he says. "We want it to be a simple list of top scores, with the player's name and score displayed next to each entry. And we need it to update in real-time as players submit their high scores."

I make a mental note to look into how I can implement this feature without having to rewrite too much code. "Alright, got it. I'll take care of it."

And with that, my next task is set in motion.

### Next Steps

* Research how to implement a real-time leaderboard
* Decide on the best approach for storing and updating high scores
* Start coding the new feature
