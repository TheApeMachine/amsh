### Response

Let's break down the task of developing a full Tetris game. Here are my thoughts on the current context:

**Game Overview**

Tetris is a classic puzzle game where players rotate and arrange falling blocks (called Tetriminos) to create solid lines without gaps. The goal is to clear as many lines as possible before the game ends.

**Key Components**

1. **Game Board**: A 10x20 grid representing the playing field.
2. **Tetriminos**: Seven different shapes, each composed of four square blocks:
	* I-Shape (straight line)
	* O-Shape (square)
	* T-Shape
	* L-Shape
	* J-Shape
	* S-Shape
	* Z-Shape
3. **Game Logic**:
	* Tetriminos fall from the top of the board at a steady pace.
	* Players can rotate and move Tetriminos left or right.
	* When a solid line is formed, it disappears, and points are awarded.
4. **Scoring**: Points are awarded for each cleared line, with more points for longer lines.

**Implementation Plan**

To develop a full Tetris game, we'll need to implement the following features:

1. **Game Board Rendering**: Create a 10x20 grid using a graphics library (e.g., Pygame).
2. **Tetrimino Generation**: Randomly select and generate Tetriminos at the top of the board.
3. **User Input Handling**: Handle player input for rotation, left/right movement, and line
