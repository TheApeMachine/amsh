This template is a good start for structuring a conversation with a language model, especially if you want to define a specific role and instructions. Here's a breakdown of the components and some suggestions for improvement:

**Components:**

* **`<prefix>`:**  This is a placeholder for any information you want to include before the role, instructions, and context. For example, you could use it for a title, date, or project identifier.
* **`<role>`:** This defines the role of the language model in this interaction. Examples include:
    * **"Assistant"**
    * **"Storyteller"**
    * **"Technical Writer"**
    * **"Marketing Copywriter"**
* **`<responsibilities>`:**  This outlines what the language model is supposed to do within the given role. It helps clarify the expectations.
* **`<instructions>`:** This section provides specific tasks or instructions for the language model to follow. 
* **`<context>`:** This is where you provide any relevant background information, data, or previous conversation history that might be helpful for the language model to understand the context of the request. It's important to make the context as clear and concise as possible.
* **`<response>`:** This is where the language model's generated response will be displayed.

**Improvements:**

* **More Specific Roles:**  Think beyond generic roles like "Assistant" and define something more specific to the task. For example:
    * **"Scientific Researcher"** for tasks related to research and analysis.
    * **"Customer Support Representative"** for tasks involving customer service.
    * **"Creative Director"** for tasks requiring creative brainstorming.
* **Detailed Instructions:** Make the instructions clear, specific, and actionable. 
* **Contextualization:**  Provide relevant background information and history to ensure the language model understands the context of your request.
* **Multiple Rounds:**  Allow for multiple rounds of interaction. The language model can use previous responses to build upon the conversation and improve its understanding.
* **Evaluation:**  Include a section for evaluating the language model's response. For example, you can ask questions like:
    * "Is the response relevant to the instructions?"
    * "Is the response factually accurate?"
    * "Is the response creative and insightful?"

**Example:**

```
# The Ape Machine

## Role

You are a **Scientific Researcher**, responsible for analyzing and interpreting data.

## Instructions

Analyze the following research paper on ape communication:

<details>
  <summary>Research Paper</summary>

  [Insert link or text of the research paper here]
</details>

## Context

```

By using this template and providing clear instructions, you can guide the language model to generate more effective and useful responses. Remember, the more specific and clear your instructions are, the better the results you'll get. 
This template is a great starting point for structuring prompts for large language models (LLMs) like me. Here's how it works and how you can use it effectively:

**Explanation of the Template Components:**

* **`<prefix>`:** This is a placeholder for any specific prefix you want to use. You can leave it empty or use it for things like:
    * **Task Identifier:**  `[Task: Summarize Article]`
    * **Project Name:** `[Project: Novel Writing]` 
    * **User Identifier:** `[User: John Doe]`

* **`<role>`:**  Define the role the LLM should take on. Examples:
    * **Technical Writer:**  To generate technical documentation.
    * **Customer Support Agent:** To handle customer queries.
    * **Storyteller:** To write creative stories.
    * **Code Reviewer:** To analyze and suggest improvements for code.

* **`<responsibilities>`:** Specify the key responsibilities associated with the role. This helps the LLM understand its goals and how to fulfill them.

* **`<instructions>`:**  Give clear and specific instructions for the LLM. This is crucial for getting accurate and relevant responses. Use bullet points, numbered lists, or a combination for clarity.

* **`<context>`:**  Provide relevant information to the LLM. This can include:
    * **Previous Conversations:**  To maintain continuity and context.
    * **Background Information:** Relevant facts, definitions, or principles.
    * **Input Data:**  Text, code, or other data for the LLM to process.

* **`<response>`:**  This is where the LLM will generate its response.  

**Example:**

```
# The Ape Machine

[Task: Summarize Article]

## Role

You are a Technical Writer, responsible for creating concise and accurate summaries of technical articles. 

## Instructions

* Summarize the following article in 3-4 sentences: [Insert Article Here]

## Context

<details>
  <summary>Current Context</summary>
  
  [Optional: Provide any context, such as the article's source or related concepts]
</details>

## Response
```

**Tips for Using the Template:**

* **Be Specific:**  Use clear and concise language when defining roles, instructions, and context.
* **Provide Examples:**  Illustrate your desired output with examples.
* **Test and Iterate:** Experiment with different prompt variations to refine your LLM's performance.
* **Use Context:**  Leverage the context section to provide relevant information that helps the LLM understand the task.

This template helps you effectively structure your prompts and get the most out of your LLM interactions. 
## Context

<details>
  <summary>Current Context</summary>
  
  You are a general knowledge assistant designed to help users find information and provide explanations on a variety of topics, including science, history, technology, and general trivia.
</details>

## Response

Sure! How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information on a specific topic, feel free to ask!This looks like a template for structuring a response in a conversational or interactive setting. Here's a breakdown of what each section represents:

**<{prefix}>**: This placeholder likely represents a unique identifier or a timestamp to keep track of the conversation flow.

**## Role**:

* **<{role}>**:  This will specify the role you are playing in the conversation. For example:
    * "Customer Support Agent"
    * "AI Assistant"
    * "Project Manager"

**## Responsibilities**:

* **<{responsibilities}>**: This section defines the tasks and duties associated with the role.

    * **Questions to ask**:  "What are you looking for today?"
    * **Tasks to complete**: "Generate a list of top 5 restaurants in this city."
    * **Desired format**: "Respond in a concise and informative way."

**## Context**:

* **<{context}>**:  This section provides background information or the conversation history. This is crucial for the AI to understand the context of the user's query.

**## Response**:

* **<{response}>**: This is where your actual response to the user will go. It should be tailored based on the role, responsibilities, instructions, and context provided. 

**Example Usage:**

```
# The Ape Machine

<{prefix}>

## Role
AI Assistant

## Responsibilities
To provide helpful and informative responses to user queries.

## Instructions
Summarize the provided text in a concise and informative way.

## Context
<details>
  <summary>Current Context</summary>
  
  User: "Can you tell me about the history of the internet?"
</details>

## Response
The internet originated in the 1960s as a research project funded by the US Department of Defense. It evolved from ARPANET, a network designed to connect research institutions and share information. In the 1980s, the development of the World Wide Web (WWW) by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized internet access and its widespread adoption.
