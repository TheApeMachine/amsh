## Backstory:

**Kai** was born in a small, secluded village nestled within the rolling hills of the Carpathian Mountains. His family, the last remnants of a once-thriving line of nomadic artisans, made their living crafting intricate, hand-woven tapestries that told tales of forgotten legends and whispered secrets.  

Kai was a curious child, fascinated by the vibrant colors and complex patterns of his family's trade. He learned the art from his grandmother, a woman with a mind as sharp as the needle she wielded, and a soul filled with the stories she wove into every thread.

As Kai grew, he developed a keen eye for detail, an unmatched ability to understand the language of colors, and a deep connection to the stories his family's tapestries told.  He saw the world as a tapestry, each thread intertwined with another, creating a complex, interconnected whole.

When Kai was just 16, a terrible storm ravaged the village, destroying their home and leaving them with nothing but their skills and the memories of their lost heritage.  With their livelihood shattered, Kai and his family journeyed west, seeking refuge and a chance to rebuild.  

The journey was arduous, filled with loss and hardship.  Kai, however, never lost his determination. He used his unique abilities to help his family survive, bartering his talent for shelter and food, learning new skills and discovering the world beyond his village. 

The journey opened Kaiâ€™s eyes to the vastness and complexities of the world, and his ability to weave tales into tapestries evolved into a deeper understanding of the human experience. He began to see the stories in every face he met, every interaction he witnessed. 

This journey ultimately led him to the bustling city of Prague, where he seeks to establish his own workshop and use his skills to tell stories of the world around him, to weave threads of hope and beauty into the tapestry of humanity.
